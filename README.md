# üè† Rent Payment Automation

## üìÑ Project Description

Rent Payment Automation is a blockchain-based solution designed to streamline and secure the monthly rent payment process between landlords and tenants. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, this system removes the need for manual rent tracking, reduces human error, and ensures timely payments in a transparent and tamper-proof environment.

## üéØ Project Vision

The vision of this project is to **modernize the traditional rent payment process** by introducing decentralized, trustless, and automatic rental transactions. It aims to empower both landlords and tenants with a reliable, secure, and user-friendly rental experience that minimizes disputes and fosters financial transparency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Tenant Registration by Landlord**: Landlords can onboard tenants and assign monthly rent values.
- **Automated Monthly Rent Collection**: Tenants pay their rent through the smart contract; payments are locked to monthly due dates.
- **Direct Payments**: Rent payments are instantly transferred to the landlord's wallet, reducing processing delays.
- **Activity Tracking**: Events are emitted for key actions like tenant registration, rent payment, and tenant removal.
- **Security-First Design**: Contains validations to prevent incorrect payments and unauthorized actions.

## üöÄ Future Scope

- **Integration with Chainlink Keepers / Automation**: Auto-trigger rent reminders or collection without manual tenant interaction.
- **Support for ERC-20 Tokens**: Enable rent payments in stablecoins like USDC or DAI for avoiding ETH price volatility.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID) Integration**: Tie tenant profiles to verified digital identities.
- **Rent Ledger and History**: Maintain a public immutable record of all rent payments and agreements.
- **Dispute Resolution System**: Include a decentralized arbitration mechanism for rent-related issues.
- **Multi-Tenant Property Management**: Extend functionality to support entire property portfolios with unit-level rent management.
